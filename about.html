		<h2><a class="header1">Experience</a></h2>
		<p>I have work experience in a few different fields including insurance, customer service, advertising, marketing, and architectural design. My roles varied greatly from company to company which speaks to my adaptability as an employee. Through my education and work experience I have learned important communication and problem-solving skills, and I find that I contribute best when working with others.</p>

		<h2><a class="header2">Looking Forward</a></h2>
		<p>I am currently majoring in marketing, but I have a wide variety of interests including management, entrepreneurship, graphic design, and digital studies. While at UW Madison I hope to explore these topics further. I have found working directly with clients to be particularly rewarding and I would love to get some experience in account management going forward. However, due to my limited amount of job exposure I am looking to get as much experience as I can in many different fields to help me discern what I want in a career.</p>
